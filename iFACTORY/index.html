    VISUAL CREATIVITY
    <br>
    There's more visual freedom in parallax website design, Rather than
    focusing on block style information architecture,you can create
    refreshing and engaging visuals such as animation or beautifual
    photography, that act as a continum,ultimately inspiring users to
    scroll further down the page.</p>

            <br>
        Do you want to tell a story with your product or service?
        Long-scrolling lends itself well to a narrative and
        encourages meaningful interaction from users</p>

        <h2 class="s__head">SIMPLE INTERFACE FOR</h2> <br>
        <p class="s__para">
        Mobile and tablets have evolved the way we engage in website. it's
        now less about clicking and more about scrolling ,swiping and tapping,
        long-scrolling websites take away the barrier of complex navigation,
        providing a responsive, user-friendly experience for mobile users.</p>

        <p class="s__para">THE POINT MESSAGING <br>
        Parallex website design is a grate solution for us time-poor
        website browsers,as it forces business to convey their
        message and vision into one dynamic web design page.</p>

    <div id="s6__img">
        <h2 class="s__head">TASIER FOR USERS TO</h2> <br>
        <p class="s__para">REALISE THEIR GOAL <br>
        There days,scrolling is so simple that it's become an
        instinctive action, whereas clicking through to another page
        requiers thought and motivation. A single page website
        allows user to identify their purpose on the website quicker,
        than needing to site through multiple pages</p>

    <div id="s7__img">
        <h2 class="s__head">LONG SCROOL: THE NOT SO GOOD STUFF </h2> <br>
        <p class="s__para">YOU NEED TO BE SEARCH ENGINE SAVVY <br>
        One of the biggest problems that parallex websites face is that
        they are not SEO friendly.why?when you limit the number of
        pages in your website, Google has fewer pages to index and
        negatively impacts your standing on the search engine results
        page(SERP).Luckily there are ways around this</p>
    </div>
    <div id="s8__img">
            <h2 class="s__heads">SLOWER LOAD TIMES</h2> <br>
            <p class="s__paras">50% of website users bounce off the page if it hasn't loaded in 3-5 seconds. So the
                more high resolution imagery and animations you include, yhe longer it takes to
                load the pages. when writing this article,we tested some popular parallax
                websites, and found that the ones with complex visuals took up to
                30 seconds to load on a mobile device, whereas simple and minimalist long-scroll websites
                loaded within a few seconds.
